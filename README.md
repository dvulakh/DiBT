# commander.go
A general distributed backtracking framework that pools local and remote processors to solve combinatorial constraint-satisfaction problems.  

`docs/documentation.3.0.1.txt` contains a table of options that can be passed to the commander program through standard input.  
Run `make example` for an example instance that solves the Costas-array problem of size 10 on 8 processors.
